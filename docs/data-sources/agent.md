## Schema

### Required

- `agent_identifier` (String) Either the GUID or ClientMachine name of the Keyfactor Command Agent.

### Read-Only

- `agent_id` (String) A string indicating the GUID of the orchestrator.
- `agent_platform` (Number) An integer indicating the platform for the orchestrator.
- `auth_certificate_reenrollment` (String) An integer indicating the value of the orchestrator certificate reenrollment request or require status. 
0 -	None—Unset the value so that the orchestrator will not request a new client authentication certificate (based on this value).
1 -	Requested—The orchestrator will request a new client authentication certificate when it next registers for a session. Orchestrator activity will be allowed to continue as usual.
2 -	Required—The orchestrator will request a new client authentication certificate when it next registers for a session. A new session will not be granted and orchestrator activity will not be allowed to continue until the orchestrator acquires a new certificate.
- `blueprint` (String) A string indicating the name of the blueprint associated with the orchestrator.
- `capabilities` (List of String) An array of strings indicating the capabilities reported by the orchestrator. These may be built-in or custom capabilities.
- `client_machine` (String) A string indicating the client machine on which the orchestrator is installed.
- `last_error_code` (Number) An integer indicating the last error code, if any, reported from the orchestrator when trying to register a session. This code is cleared on successful session registration.
- `last_error_message` (String) A string indicating the last error message, if any, reported from the orchestrator when trying to register a session. This message is cleared on successful session registration.
- `last_seen` (String) The time, in UTC, at which the orchestrator last contacted Keyfactor Command.
- `last_thumbprint_used` (String) A string indicating the thumbprint of the certificate that the orchestrator most recently used for client certificate authentication. In most cases, this will match the Thumbprint.
- `legacy_thumbprint` (String) A string indicating the thumbprint of the certificate previously used by the orchestrator for client certificate authentication before a certificate renewal operation took place (rotating the current thumbprint into the legacy thumbprint). The legacy thumbprint is cleared once the orchestrator successfully registers with the new thumbprint.
- `status` (Number) An integer indicating the orchestrator status. 1 = New, 2 = Approved, 3 = Disapproved.
- `thumbprint` (String) A string indicating the thumbprint of the certificate that Keyfactor Command is expecting the orchestrator to use for client certificate authentication.
- `username` (String) A string indicating the Active Directory user or service account the orchestrator is using to connect to Keyfactor Command.
- `version` (String) A string indicating the version of the orchestrator.
