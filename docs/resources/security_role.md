# keyfactor_security_role (Resource)

The ```keyfactor_security_role``` resource is used to create and configure Keyfactor security roles. Security roles are
used to manage privileged access in Keyfactor, and operate in conjunction to Keyfactor security identites. Roles are
the actual medium that hold specific permissions that a user or group should have access to. A detailed list of the available
permissions supported by Keyfactor roles can be found in the Keyfactor Command documentation.

## Example Usage
The following configuration of a ```keyfactor_security_role``` resource creates a new security role in Keyfactor called
```Terraform1``` and attaches a security identity with an account name configured by another resource.
```terraform
// Create a new security role in Keyfactor and attach the identity represented by the resource identity1
resource "keyfactor_security_role" "kf_terraform_role1" {
    role_name = "Terraform1"
    description = "Role used to demonstrate Keyfactor's ability to integrate with Terraform."
    identities {
        account_name = keyfactor_security_identity.identity1.account_name
    }
    permissions = ["Monitoring:Read", "SecuritySettings:Modify"]
}
```
