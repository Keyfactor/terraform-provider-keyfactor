# keyfactor_certificate (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "keyfactor" {
  username = "your_username"
  password = "your_api_password"
  hostname = "mykfinstance.kfdelivery.com"
  domain   = "mydomain.com"
}

## PFX Enrollment
resource "keyfactor_certificate" "pkcs12_enrollment" {
  common_name           = "My PKCS12 Certificate"
  country               = "US"
  state                 = "Ohio"
  locality              = "Cleveland"
  organization          = "Keyfactor"
  organizational_unit   = "Engineering"
  ip_sans               = sort(["192.168.123.2", "172.51.2.4"])
  dns_sans              = sort(["my.pkcs12.io", "My PKCS12 Certificate", "my.pkcs12.co.uk", "Certificate PKCS12 My"])
  uri_sans              = sort(["my.pkcs12.io"])
  key_password          = "Don't put this in your production code!"
  certificate_authority = "COMMAND\\MY_CA_01"
  certificate_template  = "2yrWebServer"
  metadata = {
    "Email-Contact" = "kfadmin@keyfactor.com"
    "Owner"         = "integrations@keyfactor.com"
  }
}

## CSR Enrollment
resource "tls_private_key" "rsa_4096" {
  # Create a private key for the certificate request.
  algorithm = "RSA"
  rsa_bits  = 4096
}

resource "tls_cert_request" "csr" {
  # Create a CSR using the TLS private key above
  private_key_pem = tls_private_key.rsa_4096.private_key_pem

  subject {
    common_name         = "mycsr.kfdelivery.com"
    organization        = "Keyfactor"
    country             = "US"
    locality            = "Seattle"
    organizational_unit = "DevOps Enablement"
    postal_code         = "12345"
    province            = "WA"
    street_address      = ["123 Main St", "Suite 1", "Second Floor", "Downtown"]
  }
}

resource "keyfactor_certificate" "kf_csr_cert" {
  csr                   = tls_cert_request.csr.cert_request_pem
  certificate_authority = "COMMAND\\MY_CA_01"
  certificate_template  = "2yrWebServer"

  dns_sans = ["mycsr.kfdelivery.com"]         # Optional DNS SANs
  ip_sans  = ["172.16.0.2", "192.168.0.2"]    # Optional IP SANs
  uri_sans = ["https://mycsr.kfdelivery.com"] # Optional URI SANs
  metadata = {
    "Email-Contact" = "my_username@mydomain.com"
    # Note: metadata keys must be defined in Keyfactor and cannot just be arbitrarily added
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `certificate_authority` (String) Name of certificate authority to deploy certificate with Ex: Example Company CA 1
- `certificate_template` (String) Short name of certificate template to be deployed

### Optional

- `collection_enrollment_wait` (String) The maximum time to wait for a certificate to be added to a collection, post enrollment. This is useful for certificates that trigger issue handlers and/or workflows post enrollment and will delay the certificate being added to the expected collection. Format: 1h, 1m, 1s. Default: 0.
- `collection_id` (Number) Optional certificate collection ID. This is required if enrollment permissions have been granted at the collection level. NOTE: This will *not* assign the cert to the specified collection ID; assignment is based the collection's associated query. For more information on collection permissions see the Keyfactor Command docs: https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/ReferenceGuide/CertificatePermissions.htm?Highlight=collection%20permissions
- `common_name` (String) Subject common name (CN) of the certificate.
- `country` (String) Subject country of the certificate
- `csr` (String) Base-64 encoded certificate signing request (CSR)
- `dns_sans` (List of String) List of DNS names to use as subjects of the certificate.
- `ip_sans` (List of String) List of DNS names to use as subjects of the certificate.
- `key_password` (String, Sensitive) Password used to recover the private key from Keyfactor Command. NOTE: If no value is provided a random password will be generated for key recovery. This value is not stored and does not encrypt the private key in Terraform state. Also note that if a password is provided it must meet any password complexity requirements enforced by the CA template or creation will fail. Auto-generated passwords will be of length 32 and contain a minimum of 4 of the following: uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.
- `locality` (String) Subject locality (L) of the certificate
- `metadata` (Map of String) Metadata key-value pairs to be attached to certificate
- `organization` (String) Subject organization (O) of the certificate
- `organizational_unit` (String) Subject organizational unit (OU) of the certificate
- `state` (String) Subject state (ST) of the certificate
- `uri_sans` (List of String) List of URIs to use as subjects of the certificate.

### Read-Only

- `ca_certificate` (String) PEM formatted CA certificate
- `certificate_chain` (String) PEM formatted full certificate chain
- `certificate_id` (Number) Keyfactor Command certificate ID.
- `certificate_pem` (String) PEM formatted certificate
- `command_request_id` (Number) Keyfactor request ID.
- `identifier` (String) Keyfactor certificate identifier. This can be any of the following values: thumbprint, CN, or Keyfactor Command Certificate ID. If using CN to lookup the last issued certificate, the CN must be an exact match and if multiple certificates are returned the certificate that was most recently issued will be returned.
- `issuer_dn` (String) Issuer distinguished name that signed the certificate
- `private_key` (String, Sensitive) PEM formatted PKCS#1 private key imported if cert_template has KeyRetention set to a value other than None, and the certificate was not enrolled using a CSR.
- `serial_number` (String) Serial number of newly enrolled certificate
- `thumbprint` (String) Thumbprint of newly enrolled certificate

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import keyfactor_certificate.mycert 65 # Where this is the ID of the certificate on Keyfactor
```
