### Optional

### Read-Only

- `identity_id` (Number) An integer containing the Keyfactor Command identifier for the security identity.
- `identity_type` (String) A string indicating the type of identityâ€”User or Group.
- `valid` (Boolean) A Boolean that indicates whether the security identity's audit XML is valid (true) or not (false). A security identity may become invalid if Keyfactor Command determines that it appears to have been tampered with.
