# keyfactor_certificate_deployment (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "keyfactor" {
  username = "COMMAND\\your_username"
  password = "your_api_password"
  hostname = "mykfinstance.kfdelivery.com"
  domain   = "mydomain.com"
}

## PFX Enrollment
resource "keyfactor_certificate" "PFXCertificate" {
  subject = {
    # Certificate subject metadata
    subject_common_name         = "mypfx.kfdelivery.com"
    subject_organization        = "Keyfactor"
    subject_locality            = "Cleveland"
    subject_country             = "US"
    subject_organizational_unit = "Software Development"
    subject_state               = "OH"
  }

  dns_sans     = ["meow.example.com", "meow2"]   # Optional DNS SANs
  key_password = "my certificate password!"
  # The password for the certificate. Note: This is bad practice, use TF_VAR_<variable_name> instead.
  certificate_authority = "COMMAND\\MY_CA_01" # Keyfactor CA to use to handle the certificate request.
  certificate_template  = "2yrWebServer"      # The template shortname to use for the certificate.
}

  store_type     = "IIS"                                  # Must exist in KeyFactor
  properties = {
    # Optional properties based on the store type
    UseSSL = true
  }
  inventory_schedule = "60m" # How often to update the inventory
  container_id       = 2     # ID of the KeyFactor container
  password           = "my store password!"
  # The password for the certificate store. Note: This is bad practice, use TF_VAR_<variable_name> instead.
}

  certificate_id       = keyfactor_certificate.PFXCertificate.id                          # ID of the certificate to deploy
  certificate_store_id = keyfactor_certificate_store.iis_trusted_roots.id                 # UUID of the certificate store to deploy to
  certificate_alias    = keyfactor_certificate.PFXCertificate.subject.subject_common_name # Alias to use for the certificate in the store
}

## Schema

### Required

- `certificate_alias` (String) A string providing an alias to be used for the certificate upon entry into the certificate store. The function of the alias varies depending on the certificate store type. Please ensure that the alias is lowercase, or problems can arise in Terraform Plan.
- `certificate_id` (Number) Keyfactor certificate ID
- `certificate_store_id` (String) A string containing the GUID for the certificate store to which the certificate should be added.

### Optional

- `key_password` (String, Sensitive) Password that protects PFX certificate, if the certificate was enrolled using PFX enrollment, or is password protected in general. This value cannot change, and Terraform will throw an error if a change is attempted.

### Read-Only
