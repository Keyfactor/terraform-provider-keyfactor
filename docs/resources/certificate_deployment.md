# keyfactor_certificate_deployment (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "keyfactor" {
  username = "COMMAND\\your_username"
  password = "your_api_password"
  hostname = "mykfinstance.kfdelivery.com"
  domain   = "mydomain.com"
}

# Lookup existing cert store using the client machine's name and the store path
data "keyfactor_certificate_store" "my_cert_store" {
  client_machine = "192.168.0.9"
  store_path     = "/home/azureuser/certs"
}

# Lookup existing certificate using the client machine's name and the certificate path
data "keyfactor_certificate" "ca_cert" {
  identifier   = "CommandCA1" #Certificate CN
  key_password = ""           # This is bad practice. Use TF_VAR_<variable_name> instead.
}

# Deploy the CA certificate to the certificate store
resource "keyfactor_certificate_deployment" "ca_cert_deployment" {
  certificate_id       = data.keyfactor_certificate.ca_cert.certificate_id # The Keyfactor Command internal certificate ID
  certificate_store_id = data.keyfactor_certificate_store.my_cert_store.id # The Keyfactor Command certificate store ID
  certificate_alias    = data.keyfactor_certificate.ca_cert.thumbprint     # Alias to use for the certificate in the store
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `certificate_alias` (String) A string providing an alias to be used for the certificate upon entry into the certificate store. The function of the alias varies depending on the certificate store type. Please ensure that the alias is lowercase, or problems can arise in Terraform Plan.
- `certificate_id` (Number) Keyfactor certificate ID
- `certificate_store_id` (String) A string containing the GUID for the certificate store to which the certificate should be added.

### Optional

- `key_password` (String, Sensitive) Password that protects PFX certificate, if the certificate was enrolled using PFX enrollment, or is password protected in general. This value cannot change, and Terraform will throw an error if a change is attempted.

### Read-Only
