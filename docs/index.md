# keyfactor Provider
[Keyfactor](https://www.keyfactor.com/) is an industry PKI as a
Service (PKIaaS) leader. The Keyfactor provider is used to interact
with resources supported by Keyfactor, including the automatic
enrollment of new certificates with the Keyfactor platform, and
deployment into stores managed by Keyfactor.

## Example Usage
```terraform
terraform {
    required_providers {
        keyfactor = {
            version = "~> 1.0.0"
            source  = "keyfactor.com/keyfactordev/keyfactor"
        }
    }
}

provider "keyfactor" {
    alias       = "command"
    hostname    = "keyfactor.example.com"
}
```

## Authentication
The Keyfactor provider offers two means of providing credentials for
authentication to the Keyfactor platform:
* Provider Config
* Environmnent variables

#### Provider Config
The Keyfactor Go utilities library constructs an authentication string
from a Keyfactor Username/Password. These can be provided with the
provider configuration by specifying ```kf_username``` and
```kf_password```. This method is not preferred.

#### Environment variables
The preferred authentication method is via environment variables.
The following environment variables are supported:
* ```KEYFACTOR_HOSTNAME```
* ```KEYFACTOR_USERNAME```
* ```KEYFACTOR_PASSWORD```
* ```KEYFACTOR_DOMAIN```
* ```KEYFACTOR_APPKEY``` - _not supported in v1.0.0_

##### Usage
```shell
$ export KEYFACTOR_HOSTNAME="keyfactor.example.com"
$ export KEYFACTOR_USERNAME="SA_Demo"
$ export KEYFACTOR_PASSWORD="xxx"
```
