# TODO: Convert logs to `tflog` format. (WIP: sbailey)
   - Confirm logging isn't leaking secrets
   - Determine how to silence 3rd part bin loggers like from `keyfactor-go-client`
# TODO: Test cert generation using CSR (WIP: sbailey)
    - Check that CN of cert is the same as the CN of the CSR
    - Check chain cert is from correct issuer
    - Document how SANs and CSR input are used to generate cert
     - If SANs are provided by the CSR then KF signs using those SANs verbatim and will ignore any SANs specified on the resource
     - If SANs are not provided by the CSR then KF will use the SANs specified on the resource
     ##Potential KF command bug where if template requires SANs and CSR does not contain any SANs, but SANs are provided as part of the payload, the cert will be created and will not have any SANs
    - Ensure idempotency of cert generation (apply should not continue to regenerate certs unless something has actually changed)
    - What happens w/ approvals? Does tf wait for an approval?
# TODO: Test cert store CRUD
    - Debug TF timeout issue waiting on orchestration.
    - Test binding certs to stores
    - Add X certs
    - Remove Y certs where Y < X
# TODO: Test template role binding
    - Validate invalid templates are not bound and reported as bound successfully and prevent them from getting into `tfstate`
    - Notify end-user when a template might have been deleted outside of terraform with a warning.
# TODO: Allow lookup of templates by template short name rather than by keyfactor ID
# TODO: Allow lookup of roles by role name rather than by keyfactor ID
# TODO: Allow lookup of cert by CN or serial number in addition to keyfactor ID?
# TODO: test importing an existing certificate
    - by CN
    - by serial number
    - by keyfactor ID
# TODO: test importing an existing role by name
    - by name -- failed
    - by keyfactor ID -- works
# TODO: test importing an existing identity by name
# TODO: test importing a template role binding
# TODO: test importing an existing cert store by store path?

# TODO: Review docs
# TODO: Review steps needed to publish to community terraform registry and develop plan/CICD for it.
    - Get a PGP key for signing the bins
    - GPG 
    - Chat w/ Mikey when he's back
    - How does hashicorp expect the PGP key
    - Azure key vaults

# Nice to haves
## TODO: Develop internal demo
## TODO: Develop customer demo
## TODO: Refactor role indentity binding to maybe just take in a list of identity names rather than multiple identity {} blocks
## TODO: Don't store private keys in TF state in plain text (Look at how the TLS provider stores the private key)
## TODO: Test cert_deploy resource and see if/how that can be consolidated to a single resource type?
