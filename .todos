# TODO: Convert logs to `tflog` format.
# TODO: Test cert generation using CSR
    - Check that CN of cert is the same as the CN of the CSR
    - Check chain cert is from correct issuer
    - Document how SANs and CSR input are used to generate cert
     - If SANs are provided by the CSR then KF signs using those SANs verbatim and will ignore any SANs specified on the resource
     - If SANs are not provided by the CSR then KF will use the SANs specified on the resource
    - Ensure idempotency of cert generation (apply should not continue to regenerate certs unless something has actually changed)
# TODO: Test cert store CRUD
    - Debug TF timeout issue waiting on orchestration.
    - Test binding certs to stores
    - Add X certs
    - Remove Y certs where Y < X
# TODO: Test cert_deploy resource and see if/how that can be consolidated to a single resource type?
# TODO: Test template role binding
    - Validate invalid templates are not bound and reported as bound successfully and prevent them from getting into `tfstate`
    - Notify end-user when a template might have been deleted outside of terraform with a warning.
# TODO: Refactor role indentity binding to maybe just take in a list of identity names rather than multiple identity {} blocks

# TODO: Allow lookup of roles by role name rather than by keyfactor ID
# TODO: Allow lookup of cert by CN or serial number in addition to keyfactor ID?
